Main purpose of this Vehicle system is to be a solid base for wheeled ground vehicles following the LVS vehicle standard.

To achieve this, it uses real props as wheels with spherical collisions that are attached to the body using a [url=https://youtu.be/Flex-2so_Zs]traditional rigid rope suspension with adv ballsockets[/url].
It uses the collective knowledge of the entire sandbox vehicle building community from the past ~15 years using all the little tricks and tweaks needed to make it perform well.
To my knowledge, this is the peak of what you can sequeeze out of a legitimate prop based chassis with proper rotating wheels without falling back to fake physics such as simfphys uses (non-rotating, sliding wheels) or raycast hover wheels.

This system should give you the best offroading experience aswell assuming the suspension is adjusted for it. No more sideways slide on hills ect. It is also tweaked to handle drifting.

Also includes a Armorsystem and a SWEP to repair said Armorsystem, a Fuelsystem and a Lightingsystem. Everything is still WIP and could be subject for change.
